				Benift of Co-operative Society in Bangladesh
			</h3>


A Co-operative society is an autonomous association of persons who voluntarily cooperate for their common economic interest. The following reason cooperative society is benefited in Bangladesh: 
	<ul>
		<li>
			A Co-operative society shall be accessible to all irrespective of all caste, creed, and religion of the members. This means it should not be formed only for the welfare of a particular caste or religion;
		</li>
		<li>
			A Co-operative society must necessarily be democratic in nature and be controlled by their members only;
		</li>
		<li>
			Every member of a Co-operative society shall enjoy equal voting rights in conformity with their basic principle;
		</li>
		<li>
			Every member of a Co-operative society shall enjoy equal profit sharing facility. This results in fewer chances of grievances among its members;
		</li>
		<li>
			A Co-operative society must act in the interest of its members and must co-operate with other Co-operative societies as far as practicable;
		</li>
		<li>
			Last but not the least A Co-operative society must provide priority to the welfare and sustainable development of its members.

		</li>
